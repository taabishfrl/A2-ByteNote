# ByteNote Transaction Processing and Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation for the FIT1008 assignment focused on a digital currency system called ByteNote. It includes:

- **ProcessingLine:** Handling ordered batches of transactions with critical transaction ordering.
- **ProcessingBook:** Recursive data structure for storing transactions keyed by signature prefixes.
- **FraudDetection:** Algorithms to detect suspicious transaction signatures and analyze hash function quality.

## Features

- Recursive trie-like transaction storage with collision handling.
- Custom signature block sorting and grouping for fraud detection.
- Hash function evaluation via maximum probe chain length simulation.
- Detailed complexity analysis consistent with academic guidelines.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
